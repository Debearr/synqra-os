### PAGE 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**[CLIENT NAME] — AUTOMATION BLUEPRINT**

Prepared by: NØID Labs  
Date: [DATE]  
Product: [SYNQRA / NØID / AURAFX / PACK 3]

---

**YOUR CURRENT PROBLEM**

[One paragraph. Plain language. No jargon. State the core pain point.]

Example (Synqra):  
You're spending 20+ hours per week on tasks that don't create content: sponsor outreach, post scheduling, analytics review, admin work. That's 1,040 hours per year—time you could spend creating, growing your audience, or closing bigger deals. The cost? Lost revenue, slower growth, and burnout.

---

**OUR SOLUTION**

[One paragraph. Outcome-focused. Clear.]

Example (Synqra):  
We build a custom automation system that handles your backend: sponsor outreach, content scheduling, analytics aggregation, and workflow coordination. You focus on creating. The system handles everything else. Result: 15–20 hours back per week, faster sponsor response times, and scalable infrastructure.

---

**YOUR ROI**

- **Time Saved**: [X] hours per week = [Y] hours per year
- **Cost Saved**: [Annual cost of manual work] per year
- **Revenue Gained**: [Estimated additional earnings from reclaimed time/efficiency]
- **Payback Period**: [Months] to break even
- **Net Benefit Year 1**: $[Total savings/gains minus investment]

## Part F: Integration Summary

**How These Components Work Together**

1. **Lead comes in** → KIE.AI classifies → Stored in `leads` table

2. **Qualification call** → Agent follows Call 1 framework → Books $2,500 diagnostic

3. **Pre-call brief** → Claude generates using internal brief template → Stored in `consultation_briefs`

4. **Diagnostic call** → Agent follows Call 2 framework → Uses workflow mapping template → ROI calculator

5. **Blueprint generation** → OpenAI uses client-facing template + internal brief → Stored in `blueprints` table

6. **Blueprint review call** → Agent follows Call 3 framework → Presents pricing → Handles objections

7. **Close or no-close** → Data logged in Supabase (`blueprint_accepted`, `close_reason`)

8. **Monthly learning** → Claude analyzes past month → Generates learning report → Improvements implemented

9. **Quarterly deep dive** → Manual review + AI assistance → Major refinements → System optimization

---

**No New Tools. No New Tables (except minimal fields). Just Smarter Use of Existing Systems.**

---

**END OF DELIVERABLE 3**

This blueprint template + learning loop integrates Chris Do (clarity), Hormozi (ROI), and Nate Herk (workflow mapping) into a unified client deliverable and continuous improvement system. Everything works within existing Supabase + n8n + KIE.AI + Claude + OpenAI architecture.
