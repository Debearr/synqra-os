# AuraFX — Stop Trading on Emotion. Start Trading on System.

---

## Every Trade You Miss or Mistime Costs You Money.

You're watching five screens.  
Monitoring Discord, Twitter, news feeds.  
Trying to catch signals before they move.  
Second-guessing entries. Exiting too early. Holding too long.

**The cost?**  
Missed opportunities.  
Emotional decisions.  
Inconsistent returns.

You know what to do.  
But doing it under pressure, in real-time, across multiple pairs?  
That's where you lose.

---

## Here's What Automation Gives You

**Signal Aggregation**  
Pull signals from all your sources into one view.  
Prioritize by confidence, timeframe, risk.  
No more tab-switching. No more missed entries.

**Emotionless Execution**  
Pre-defined rules. Automated risk management. Consistent sizing.  
You set the strategy. The system executes.  
No FOMO. No panic exits.

**Real-Time Performance Tracking**  
See your win rate. Your drawdown. Your risk-adjusted returns.  
By strategy. By pair. By timeframe.  
Know what works. Kill what doesn't.

**Stress Reduction**  
Stop staring at charts 16 hours a day.  
Your system monitors. You trade when it matters.

## What You'll Gain

**Consistency**  
Stop emotional trading. Start systematic execution.  
Better risk management = smaller drawdowns.

**Time**  
10–20 hours per week saved on research and monitoring.  
Your system watches. You act when it matters.

**Clarity**  
Know your edge. Know your risk. Know your performance.  
Real-time analytics = real-time improvement.

**Confidence**  
Stop second-guessing. Stop revenge trading.  
Your system is tested. Your rules are clear. You execute.

- You're not willing to spend $2,500 on a diagnostic
- You're "just exploring"
- You expect the system to trade for you with zero input

## FAQ

**Q: Will this guarantee winning trades?**  
A: No. Nothing guarantees winning trades. This is execution infrastructure, not a magic signal service. If your strategy is bad, automation won't fix it. If your strategy is good, automation makes it consistent.

**Q: What if the blueprint shows automation won't help me?**  
A: Then we tell you. You keep the blueprint. You learn what won't work. You save yourself from a bad investment.

**Q: What if I don't move forward after the consultation?**  
A: That's fine. The $2,500 is non-refundable, but you keep the blueprint. Use it yourself or hire someone else to build it.

**Q: How much does the full build cost?**  
A: Depends on your needs. Typical range: $12K–$40K. You'll see exact pricing in your blueprint.

**Q: How long does implementation take?**  
A: 6–9 weeks from contract signing to handoff.

**Q: Can this trade for me automatically?**  
A: We can build automated execution, but YOU still need to approve strategies and monitor performance. This isn't a "set and forget" bot. It's decision-support infrastructure.

**Q: What if I need changes later?**  
A: We offer support packages. Or you can manage it yourself—it's your system.
