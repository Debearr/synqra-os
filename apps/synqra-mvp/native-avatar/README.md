# Native Avatar Scaffold (Phase 2)

This folder reserves the native client integration for real-time avatar streaming.

- **api/placeholder.ts** — stub entry for streaming socket hooks
- **model/structure.json** — metadata describing on-device buffers and voice settings

Phase 2 will bind the BullMQ worker output to a native bridge without altering the Phase 1 API.
