Why 80% of Premium Homes Sell Without Hitting MLS The most desirable properties often trade hands through private networks, never reaching public listings. Here's the reality: • Pre-Market Advantage: Sellers avoid market time and maintain privacy • Qualified Buyer Pool: Access to vetted prospects with proven means • Price Protection: No public record of price adjustments or days on market • Exclusivity Factor: Creates urgency among serious buyers • Network Effect: Top agents leverage relationships built over decades The takeaway? True luxury real estate operates in a parallel market where relationships and discretion outweigh traditional selling methods. [synqra]
