# Pilot Onboarding Notes (Internal)

## Common Objections
- "I already use Canva, why switch?"
- "I am worried this will add compliance risk."
- "I do not want another tool that needs setup each listing."
- "Will this work with my existing brokerage brand?"

## Confusion Points
- Difference between onboarding signature style and per-generation inputs.
- Why pilot access is restricted to allowlisted accounts only.
- Signed URL behavior:
  - Link expires in 24 hours.
  - Asset file remains in storage until cleanup policy runs.
- Required fields for generation versus optional fields (logo, agent name, EHO toggle).

## Completion Friction
- First login is blocked when account email/user ID is not allowlisted.
- Upload failures from oversized or unsupported logo files.
- Property photo rejected when below minimum 1200x1200.
- Address validation failures for non-GTA or malformed addresses.
- Rate limit hit after repeated retries in short windows.

## Capture During Pilot Calls
- Time from first login to first successful download.
- Number of retries before successful generation.
- Exact error codes returned for failed attempts.
- Whether user asks for manual intervention to complete first asset.
