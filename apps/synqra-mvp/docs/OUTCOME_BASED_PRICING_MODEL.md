# Outcome-Based Pricing Model

## 1. Definition of an Outcome in Synqra
An outcome is a completed business deliverable, not an activity count.

In Synqra, an outcome must satisfy all three conditions:
- Approved content: the operator accepts the output as usable.
- Campaign-ready output: the asset is ready to publish, send, or hand off.
- Confirmed action: a concrete next action is recorded (publish, export, send to team, or schedule).

If these conditions are not met, the work is not counted as an outcome.

## 2. Why This Replaces Activity Pricing
Activity pricing rewards motion (prompts, tokens, generations).
Outcome pricing rewards completed value.

This improves alignment:
- Customer pays for usable business progress, not model interaction volume.
- Synqra is incentivized to produce fewer, better outputs that are accepted and acted on.

## 3. Transition from Current $49 / $99 Baseline
Current baseline:
- $49
- $99

Transition approach:
- Keep $49 and $99 as temporary commercial anchors.
- Redefine them by outcome entitlement instead of usage entitlement.

Proposed structure:
- Outcome Tier A (mapped from $49):
  - Includes a fixed number of approved campaign-ready outcomes per period.
  - Best for focused operators with lower throughput.
- Outcome Tier B (mapped from $99):
  - Includes a higher number of approved campaign-ready outcomes per period.
  - Best for teams running multiple active initiatives.

## 4. Outcome Accounting Rules
- Count only when all three outcome conditions are met.
- Revisions inside the same deliverable are part of one outcome until approval.
- Rejected drafts do not count as outcomes.
- Confirmed action is required for completion status.

## 5. Commercial Benefits
- Predictable value framing for buyers.
- Cleaner ROI discussion for investors.
- Better margin protection than token-based race-to-zero pricing.

## 6. Implementation Boundary (Current State)
This document defines commercial logic only.
No billing engine or enforcement refactor is included in this scope.
