  overview:
    "Synqra is a content intelligence platform built for the post-generic era. Where others offer tools, we deliver infrastructure—Apple-grade simplicity wrapped around Tesla-grade architecture. The Synqra Intelligence Kernel learns from every interaction, routes tasks across optimal AI models, and scales intelligence without scaling costs.",

  marketProblem:
    "Content creation is broken. Enterprises burn $10K–$50K per campaign on fragmented workflows. SMBs sacrifice brand consistency for speed. Luxury brands—who demand precision—have zero AI tools meeting their standards. The market is saturated with generic outputs, slow agencies, and one-size-fits-none solutions.",
