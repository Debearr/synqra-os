# Codex — Avatar Engine PR Sweep & Safe Merge

## Block 1 — PR Classification
No remote or local open pull requests were available in this workspace. Unable to classify PRs without repository network access.

| PR # | Classification | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| n/a | n/a | No open PR metadata available locally or via remote. |

## Block 2 — Auto-Fix (Safe & Fixable)
No candidates processed because no PRs were available to classify.

## Block 3 — Close Rejected PRs
No PRs closed. Reason: no PR metadata accessible from this environment.

## Block 4 — Execute Safe Merge & Final Audit
- No merges executed.
- Protected paths unaffected: `/lib/avatar/*`, `/app/api/avatar/*`, `setup_and_run.sh`, and configured ports (3000, 3003, 3004).
- Final status: **BLOCKED** — awaiting PR metadata or remote access to proceed with sweep and verification.
