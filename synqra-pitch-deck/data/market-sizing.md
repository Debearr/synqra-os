## Market Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Market Size Overestimated

**Risk:** Fewer creators willing to pay $99-299/month than projected

**Mitigation:**
- Founder is Customer Zero (at least 1 paying customer validated)
- 47 waitlist members (organic demand signal)
- Existing budget: creators already pay $600-1,200/year for tools
- Switching cost low (just consolidating existing spend)

**Worst case:** Hit 50% of projections = $20-25M ARR (still attractive business)

---

### Risk 2: Market Adoption Slower Than Expected

**Risk:** Education needed, 12-18 month sales cycles, slow ramp

**Mitigation:**
- Balance enterprise (slow) with Creator/Pro tiers (fast-moving)
- 70% of Y1 revenue from fast-moving segments
- Enterprise upside, not dependency
- Adjust marketing spend based on conversion data (pivot if needed)

---

### Risk 3: Competition Enters Orchestration Category

**Risk:** Jasper/Copy.ai add multi-model routing, compress margins

**Mitigation:**
- 12-18 month first-mover advantage (they're locked into contracts)
- Brand intelligence moat (takes 18 months to replicate dataset)
- Luxury positioning (can't copy without abandoning existing customers)
- Network effects (template marketplace, Y2) create switching costs

---

### Risk 4: Model Pricing Changes Impact Economics

**Risk:** API costs rise 50%+, unit economics break

**Mitigation:**
- Diversified across 6+ providers (can route around expensive models)
- 90% gross margins = can absorb 20-30% cost increase
- Pass-through pricing option (enterprise contracts allow adjustment)
- Monitor pricing weekly, switching playbooks ready

---
