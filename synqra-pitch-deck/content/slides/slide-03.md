### The Perfect Storm for AI Orchestration

**Three forces are colliding right now:**

### 1. Model Explosion (2023-2025)
- GPT-4, Claude 3.5, Gemini Ultra, Llama 3, DeepSeek, Perplexity
- No single model dominates—each excels at different tasks
- **Founders are drowning in choice without a conductor**

### 2. Multi-Modal Maturity
- Text, image, video, voice—all production-ready
- But zero native integration between modalities
- **Content workflows still manual duct tape**

### 3. Cost Compression Race
- API prices dropped 90% in 18 months
- Competitive pressure = ongoing price wars
- **Smart routing = 30x cost advantage over single-model lock-in**

## The Insight

**The AI infrastructure is ready.**  
**The orchestration layer is missing.**

Synqra is the conductor for the multi-model orchestra.

## Market Timing Proof

- **2023:** ChatGPT hits 100M users (awareness)
- **2024:** Multi-model APIs go mainstream (infrastructure)
- **2025:** Orchestration becomes the moat (Synqra's moment)

## Design Notes

- Three pillars layout (1, 2, 3 stacked vertically or side-by-side)
- Numbers in Gold accent (#D4AF37)
- Section headers in Teal signature (#008B8B)
- "The Insight" callout box - Matte Black background, Gold border, Dust text
- Timeline graphic at bottom showing market readiness curve

## Talking Points

- Window is NOW - first mover in orchestration layer
- Models are commoditizing, routing is the new moat
- De Bear saw this gap while building content daily
- This is infrastructure-level opportunity disguised as content tool
