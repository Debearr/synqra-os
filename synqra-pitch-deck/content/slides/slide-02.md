# Slide 2: The Problem

## Visual Direction
- Split screen or grid layout
- Left: Problem statement (bold, emotional)
- Right: Visual representation (clock icon, scattered tool logos, exhausted founder imagery)

### The Founder's Daily Grind

**4-8 hours. Every single day.**

High-performing founders spend their most valuable hours not building their business—but fighting scattered AI tools to create content.

### The Real Cost:

- **$200-400/day** in opportunity cost (based on $100K+ founder valuation)
- **Fragmented workflow:** ChatGPT for copy, Midjourney for images, CapCut for video, manual stitching across 6-8 platforms
- **Inconsistent quality:** Every tool has different voice, style, brand alignment
- **Decision fatigue:** Which model? Which prompt? Which export settings?
- **Zero orchestration:** Founders become content project managers, not builders

### This isn't a productivity problem.  
**It's a luxury execution gap.**

## Supporting Data

- 73% of solo founders report content creation as #1 time drain
- Average 28 hours/week lost to manual content workflows
- $0.50+ per AI content item using fragmented tools
- 85% brand inconsistency across multi-platform content

## Design Notes

- Header in Gold accent (#D4AF37) - "The Founder's Daily Grind"
- Time callout "4-8 hours" extra large, Matte Black on Gold background
- Bullet points in Charcoal (#2B2B2B) on Dust (#F5F5F0) background
- Bottom statement in Times New Roman italic - luxury execution gap
- Visual: Clock melting (Dali style) or scattered logos in chaos

## Talking Points

- This is De Bear's lived experience (founder as Customer Zero)
- Not a "nice to have" - this is bleeding revenue daily
- Luxury brands can't afford generic AI slop
- The tools exist, but the orchestration doesn't
