## Design Notes

- Large comparison table - clean, minimal design
- Synqra row highlighted in Gold accent (#D4AF37) background
- "30x - 125x more efficient" in huge, bold type
- Cost numbers prominent - this is the slide investors will screenshot
- Time savings table in second half
- Use Teal signature (#008B8B) for "Time Saved" column
- Matte Black background, Dust text for readability

## Talking Points

- This isn't marginal improvement - it's order of magnitude shift
- Cost savings compound over time (brand intelligence gets smarter)
- Time savings are the real ROI - founders buy back their lives
- Economic moat: as API prices drop, Synqra's advantage grows (intelligent routing beats single-model contracts)
