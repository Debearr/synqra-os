## Unit Economics

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): $240
- Primarily content marketing, community, thought leadership
- Low paid acquisition initially
- Founder's LinkedIn/network as primary channel

### Lifetime Value (LTV): $1,680 (Creator tier) to $15,120 (Enterprise)
- Average customer lifetime: 4.2 years (estimated based on productivity tool benchmarks)
- High retention due to brand intelligence lock-in (switching cost = retraining AI)

### LTV:CAC Ratio: **7:1 (Creator)** to **63:1 (Enterprise)**
- Well above 3:1 healthy threshold
- Enterprise motion highly profitable

### Payback Period: **6-9 months**
- Fast capital recovery
- Sustainable growth without constant capital injection

---

## Revenue Expansion Strategy

### Land and Expand:
1. **Land:** Creator tier ($99/mo) - low friction entry
2. **Grow:** Usage increases → Professional tier ($299/mo)
3. **Expand:** Team/agency adoption → Enterprise ($120K+/year)

### Additional Revenue Opportunities (Future):
- Template marketplace (creator-to-creator sharing, 30% platform fee)
- White-label licensing to agencies
- API usage overage fees
- Premium model access (GPT-5, Claude Opus, etc. when released)

## Design Notes

- Three-tier pricing table prominently displayed
- Gold accent (#D4AF37) for "Professional" tier (recommended)
- Teal signature (#008B8B) for Enterprise tier
- Revenue projection chart (bar graph showing Y1, Y2, Y3 growth)
- Unit economics box with LTV:CAC ratio in large, bold numbers
- NØID Labs section smaller, clearly marked as "Secondary/Supporting"
- Clean, financial-presentation aesthetic

## Talking Points

- SaaS recurring revenue is primary business
- NØID Labs proves founder can execute, but not the core growth driver
- Unit economics are strong - profitable at scale
- Enterprise motion unlocks massive ACV without proportional cost increase
- Pricing validated by founder's willingness to pay (Customer Zero proof)
- Lock-in through brand intelligence - switching cost high once trained
