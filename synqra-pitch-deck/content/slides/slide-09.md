- **Year 1:** 2,500 creator/founder accounts @ $99-299/mo = $3-7.5M ARR
- **Year 2:** 8,000 accounts + 50 agency seats @ $499-999/mo = $12-18M ARR
- **Year 3:** 18,000 accounts + 200 enterprise = $30-50M ARR

**Assumptions:**
- 1-2% conversion from awareness to paid (conservative)
- 85% annual retention (high-value customers, sticky product)

## Why This Market is Ready

### 1. **Pain is Universal and Expensive**
- Every founder/creator faces the 4-8 hour content grind
- Current solutions inadequate (single-model or fully manual)

### 2. **Buyers Have Budget**
- Target audience already spending $600-1,200/year
- Synqra is value-up, not cost-down play
- Time savings justify 2-3x premium over basic tools

### 3. **Competition is Fragmented**
- No dominant orchestration player
- Incumbents locked into single-model platforms
- Window for first-mover advantage: 12-18 months

### 4. **Network Effects Possible**
- Brand intelligence improves with scale
- Template marketplace (creators sharing workflows)
- Agency white-label opportunities
