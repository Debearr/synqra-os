# Slide 6: How It Works

## Visual Direction
- Flow diagram or step-by-step visual
- Clean, architectural layout
- Show input → orchestration → output

---

## Content

### The Synqra Content Engine

**From founder's idea to finished content in three steps:**

---

## Step 1: Creator Input
**What:** Founder submits content brief via unified interface

- Topic, tone, target audience, brand guidelines
- Can be as simple as "LinkedIn post about [topic]" or detailed creative brief
- No prompt engineering required - Synqra translates intent to optimal prompts

---

## Step 2: Intelligent Orchestration
**What:** Synqra's routing layer analyzes and delegates

### The Router Evaluates:
- **Task complexity:** Simple caption vs long-form article
- **Quality requirements:** Draft vs polished vs luxury-grade
- **Cost optimization:** Balance quality vs budget
- **Speed requirements:** Instant vs refined over time

### Then Routes To:
- **Text:** GPT-4 (creative), Claude (analytical), DeepSeek (speed/cost)
- **Images:** DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion
- **Video:** CapCut automation, Runway ML
- **Voice:** ElevenLabs, OpenAI TTS

### Brand Intelligence Layer:
- Maintains voice consistency
- Applies luxury positioning filter
- Ensures on-brand execution across all models

---

## Step 3: Unified Output
**What:** Complete content package delivered

- Copy + visuals + video (if requested)
- All assets properly formatted, exported, ready to publish
- Analytics and performance tracking built in
- One-click publish or manual review/edit

---

## The Magic: Invisible Complexity

**Founder sees:** Simple interface, beautiful output  
**Synqra handles:** Multi-model routing, cost optimization, brand consistency, format conversion, quality control

---

## Technical Advantage

- **Proprietary routing algorithm:** Not just API calls, intelligent decision-making
- **Brand memory system:** Learns from every interaction
- **Cost optimization engine:** Always finding the best quality/price ratio
- **Multi-modal coordination:** Text, image, video work together, not separately

---

## Design Notes

- Three-step flow: numbered circles (1, 2, 3) in Gold accent (#D4AF37)
- Step 2 (orchestration) takes up most visual space - this is the core innovation
- Show branching diagram: one input splits to multiple models, reconverges to unified output
- Icons for each model (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) in Teal signature (#008B8B)
- "The Magic" callout box with Times New Roman italic
- Architecture diagram style - clean lines, minimal color

## Talking Points

- This is NOT just API wrappers - routing intelligence is proprietary
- Every other tool locks you into one model - Synqra uses the best tool for each job
- Like having an AI chief of staff who knows when to delegate to specialists
- Technical moat: routing algorithm + brand intelligence + multi-modal coordination
