  "statement": "NØID sells freedom. We eliminate the grind, the repetition, and the noise — by automating what slows people down. We’re not here just to build apps or websites. We’re building intelligent systems — made for drivers, creators, and brands — that give them time, money, and focus back. Our goal isn’t expansion for expansion’s sake. It’s precision — growing into industries where our technology fits naturally and delivers real impact. That’s the story. That’s the pitch. And that’s why it wins.",
