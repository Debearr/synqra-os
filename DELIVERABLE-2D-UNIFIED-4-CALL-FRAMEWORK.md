# DELIVERABLE 2D — UNIFIED 4-CALL FRAMEWORK

## Framework Philosophy

This is NOT a script.  
This is a strategic framework.

**Chris Do** guides how we communicate: clarity, simplicity, outcome-focus.  
**Hormozi** guides how we frame value: Dream Outcome, ROI, payback period.  
**Nate Herk** guides how we discover workflows: pain points, process mapping, automation opportunities.

Agents must LISTEN and ADAPT in real-time.  
No robotic scripts. No corporate jargon.  
Premium, direct, confident communication.

## Call 1 — Qualification & Pre-Diagnostic (15–20 min)

### Objective
Confirm fit. Set expectations. Book diagnostic consultation.

### Framework Structure

**Opening (Chris Do Clarity)**
- "Thanks for reaching out. I want to make sure we're a fit before we waste each other's time. Fair?"
- "Tell me: what's the biggest problem you're dealing with right now?"

**Discovery (Active Listening)**
- Listen for: Pain intensity, outcome desired, timeline urgency, budget awareness.
- Don't pitch. Don't solve yet. Just understand.

**Confirmation (Hormozi Frame)**
- "So if I'm hearing you right, you want [DREAM OUTCOME], and the cost of not fixing this is [PAIN COST]. That sound right?"

**Qualification Check**
- "Have you thought about what it's worth to solve this? I ask because our diagnostic consultation is $2,500, and if that's a dealbreaker, it's better to know now."

**If Qualified → Book Diagnostic**
- "Here's what happens next. You pay $2,500 for a 90-minute diagnostic. We audit your entire workflow. You get a custom blueprint—8 to 12 pages—showing exactly how automation solves your problem, what it costs, and what your ROI looks like. Then you decide. No pressure. Fair?"
- "If you're good with that, let's get you scheduled."

**If Not Qualified → Graceful Exit**
- "I don't think we're a fit right now. Here's why: [HONEST REASON]. If things change, reach back out. But I don't want to waste your $2,500."

### Key Principles
- Be direct. No corporate fluff.
- Disqualify fast if not a fit.
- Set clear expectations: $2,500 is non-refundable, blueprint is theirs regardless of next steps.
- No pitching yet. Just clarity and fit assessment.

## Call 2 — Diagnostic Consultation (90 min)

### Objective
Deep workflow discovery. Understand pain points. Map automation opportunities. Set stage for blueprint.

### Pre-Call Prep
- Review Claude-generated pre-call brief.
- Study their industry, workflow, pain points.
- Prepare tailored discovery questions.

### Framework Structure

**Part 1: Pain Deep-Dive (20 min) — Chris Do + Hormozi**
- "Let's start with the problem. Walk me through a typical day/week. What takes the most time?"
- "Where do things break down? Where do you lose money or opportunities?"
- "If we could fix ONE thing today, what would have the biggest impact?"

Listen for:
- Time wasted (quantify hours)
- Money lost (quantify dollars)
- Stress points (emotional cost)
- Bottlenecks (where workflow breaks)

**Part 2: Workflow Mapping (30 min) — Nate Herk**
- "Let's map your current process step by step."
- Use screen share or whiteboard.
- Identify: Manual tasks, repetitive tasks, error-prone tasks, integration gaps.

Ask:
- "What happens when [X]?"
- "How do you currently handle [Y]?"
- "What systems do you use? How do they talk to each other?"

Map:
- Current state (messy, manual, painful)
- Ideal state (automated, efficient, scalable)
- Gap between them (where automation fits)

**Part 3: Outcome Clarification (20 min) — Hormozi**
- "Let's talk about where you want to be. What does success look like?"
- "If this works perfectly, what changes for you?"
- "How much time do you want back? How much more revenue do you want? How much less stress?"

Frame:
- Dream Outcome (specific, measurable)
- Perceived Likelihood (why they believe it's possible)
- Time Delay (how fast they need results)
- Effort & Sacrifice (how hands-off they want it)

**Part 4: Blueprint Preview (20 min) — All Three**
- "Based on what I'm hearing, here's what I'd recommend at a high level."
- Show automation approach (conceptual, not detailed).
- Preview ROI model: "You're wasting X hours per week. That's $Y per year. If we automate Z, you get that back."
- Set pricing expectations: "Projects like this typically range from $A to $B, depending on scope. Your blueprint will have exact numbers."

**Closing**
- "You'll get your blueprint within 48 hours. It'll have everything: workflow diagrams, ROI model, implementation roadmap, pricing options."
- "Review it. Think it over. We'll schedule a follow-up call to discuss. Sound good?"

### Key Principles
- This is NOT a sales call. It's a diagnostic.
- Be curious. Listen more than you talk.
- Map workflows with precision (Nate Herk).
- Frame outcomes with clarity (Chris Do + Hormozi).
- No hard close. Just clarity and next steps.

## Call 3 — Blueprint Review & Pricing Presentation (45–60 min)

### Objective
Walk through blueprint. Explain ROI. Present pricing. Handle objections. Close or clarify next steps.

### Pre-Call Prep
- Send blueprint 48 hours in advance.
- Confirm client reviewed it.
- Prepare to answer technical and pricing questions.

### Framework Structure

**Part 1: Blueprint Walkthrough (20 min) — Chris Do Clarity**
- "Let's walk through your blueprint. I want to make sure everything makes sense."
- Go page by page:
  - Executive Summary: Problem, solution, ROI.
  - Current State: Workflow diagram, pain points.
  - Proposed Solution: Automation architecture (high-level, clear).
  - ROI Model: Time saved, cost saved, revenue gained.
  - Implementation: Timeline, phases, handoff.

Check understanding:
- "Does this match what you're experiencing?"
- "Does the solution make sense?"
- "Any questions so far?"

**Part 2: ROI Deep-Dive (15 min) — Hormozi**
- "Let's talk numbers."
- Show:
  - Current cost of inaction: Hours wasted × hourly value = $ lost per year.
  - Automation benefit: Hours saved × hourly value = $ gained per year.
  - Payback period: Investment ÷ annual savings = months to break even.

Example:
- "You're wasting 20 hours/week on manual tasks. That's 1,040 hours/year. At $100/hour value, that's $104K/year you're losing. If we automate 80% of that, you get back $83K/year. Our investment is $25K. Payback in 3.6 months. Make sense?"

**Part 3: Pricing Presentation (10 min) — Chris Do + Hormozi**
- "Here are your options. I structured it so you can choose what fits your budget and goals."

Present tiers:
- **Tier 1: Core Automation** — Essentials only. Fastest ROI.
- **Tier 2: Full System** — Core + optimization. Maximum impact.
- **Tier 3: Full System + Ongoing Support** — Everything + maintenance.

Frame as investment, not cost:
- "This isn't an expense. It's infrastructure. It pays for itself, then keeps paying."

**Part 4: Objection Handling (10–15 min) — Active Listening**

Common objections:
1. **"It's too expensive."**
   - "Compared to what? You're losing $X per year doing it manually. This pays for itself in Y months."
   - "What's the cost of NOT fixing this?"

2. **"I need to think about it."**
   - "Totally fair. What specifically do you need to think about? Budget? Timeline? Technical approach?"
   - Clarify, don't pressure.

3. **"Can we do it cheaper?"**
   - "We can reduce scope, but that changes the outcome. What specifically would you cut?"
   - Hold firm on value, adjust scope if needed.

4. **"What if it doesn't work?"**
   - "We guarantee the system works as designed. What we don't guarantee is that you'll use it or that external factors won't change. This is infrastructure, not magic."

5. **"I want to build it myself / hire someone cheaper."**
   - "That's an option. You have the blueprint. You can do that. But consider: our expertise, speed, and quality vs. trial-and-error. Your call."

**Closing**
- "So where are you at? Ready to move forward, or do you need more time?"
- If YES: "Great. I'll send the contract today. 50% upfront, 50% on completion. We kick off next week."
- If NO: "No problem. You have the blueprint. If things change, reach back out."

### Key Principles
- Confidence without arrogance.
- Clarity without jargon.
- Value framing (Hormozi), not feature dumping.
- Handle objections with logic, not manipulation.
- Close or clarify. No limbo.
